In 1995 Self Financed Engineering Course were added to Sardar Patel College of Engineering and the college has been conducting Electronics Engineering, Computer Engineering and Information Technology Courses from 1995-1996 and Masters course in Electronics since 2005 till 2008. These courses have earned a great reputation in the field of engineering education, as well as industry. The University of Mumbai desired that these self financed courses be separated and housed in a separate building and developed as a separate self financed entity. Thus Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s Sardar Patel College of Engineering, Unaided Wing from year 2005-2006 was established in its new building under the name and style of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s Sardar Patel Institute of Technology and is affiliated to Mumbai University.</string>
